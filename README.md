# Thermostat

![Image of the Thermostat](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bkat92cvjhddq3z/thermostat.png/)

An implementation of a thermostat in Javascript. 

## Installation

`git clone git@github.com:adc17/thermostat.git`

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser of your choice and use the UI. You can increase/decrease the temperature to defined limits, toggle power-saving mode, reset the temperature to a default of 20 degrees, and load a weather report on a city of your choice, which defaults to Henry, Illinois.

## Tests

Open `SpecRunner.html` in a web browser of your choice.

## Other Implementaions

At Makers Academy, we switch pair partners each day and work on whoever's version of the project is least advanced. I worked on one other version of this week's project, available [here](https://github.com/BenNoonan1991/thermostat). It is only half a day's work and has no GUI, but it implements the project's basic temperature-changing and power-saving features.

## Other Notes

Completed during week five of the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) Bootcamp. CSS styling for the buttons is shameless lifted from [learnlayout.com/](http://learnlayout.com/).
